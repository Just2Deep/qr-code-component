### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was really helpful to test my flexbox skills to center the components. Flexbox makes centering and placing content very simple.

### Continued development

Need to work on understanding the importance of margins and paddings when viewports change.we can give dynamic values and also the height and width of containers.
